Project Overview
For this project, I worked on a pirate intelligent agent that uses deep Q-learning to figure out how to get to the treasure before a human player. The starter code already had the maze set up along with some helper functions,
but I had to write the actual Q-learning algorithm to train the agent. At first, it just wandered around randomly, but over time it started learning the best moves. I tweaked things like epsilon decay, learning rate,
and rewards to help it get better at finding the treasure faster.

How This Connects to Computer Science
This project really showed me how reinforcement learning fits into the bigger world of computer science. Computer scientists are all about problem-solving, breaking things down into smaller steps, and figuring out the most
efficient way to do something kind of like how the pirate agent learns the best path over time.

It also made me think about how AI like this is used in real life, not just in games. This kind of decision-making is huge in self-driving cars, warehouse robots, and even optimizing internet traffic. The idea that an AI
can learn from trial and error without someone explicitly programming every decision is kind of wild when you think about it.

Ethical Responsibilities
One thing I hadn’t really thought much about before is how AI can pick up biases if it’s not trained right. If my pirate agent was only tested on one type of maze, it might completely fail on a different one. In real-world
AI, that could mean a model making bad decisions because it wasn’t trained on a wide enough variety of data.

As a computer scientist, I feel like part of the job is making sure AI is fair, explainable, and safe for the people using it. That means designing models that aren’t just accurate but also transparent and accountable.
Especially in fields like healthcare or finance, AI making the wrong call could have serious consequences, so it’s important to think about who is affected by these decisions and how to minimize harm.

Final Thoughts
This project was a fun way to get hands-on experience with reinforcement learning and neural networks. It also made me realize that computer science isn’t just about coding—it’s about solving problems efficiently
and responsibly.
